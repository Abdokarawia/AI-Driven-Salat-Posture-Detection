# SalatPose: AI-Powered Salat Posture Recognition System 🕌🙏

**SalatPose** is an innovative AI-powered system that accurately detects and recognizes critical postures in the Islamic prayer ritual (Salat). Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the system identifies essential Salat postures such as **Ruku (bowing)**, **Raising**, and **Takbeer (standing)**, ensuring that users can perform their prayers precisely and confidently.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes cutting-edge neural network models, including **Faster R-CNN** and **YOLO V8**, to enable real-time, high-precision detection of Salat postures.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Integrates the **Mediapipe Pose** model to capture the unique angles and positions that define each posture, improving recognition accuracy.
- **Educational Tool**: Aims to serve as a valuable tool for educational purposes, helping users learn and perfect their prayer postures.
- **Corrective Feedback**: Provides feedback on prayer posture alignment to ensure adherence to traditional practices.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Faster R-CNN**: A deep learning model that excels in object detection tasks, applied here to detect Salat postures.
- **YOLO V8**: A state-of-the-art model known for its speed and precision in real-time object detection.
- **Mediapipe Pose**: A framework by Google that allows for the detection of human body pose landmarks, further enhancing the system's ability to recognize Salat postures.

## 🎯 Purpose

SalatPose aims to blend technology with cultural heritage, creating meaningful innovations that respect and support religious practices. Whether you're a student learning Salat or looking to ensure your prayer postures align with tradition, SalatPose is designed to help you accurately and efficiently.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Pose Detection**: The system first uses the YOLO V8 and Faster R-CNN models to identify the body posture.
2. **Posture Recognition**: The Mediapipe Pose model analyzes the detected pose to ensure it matches one of the fundamental Salat postures.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Based on the analysis, SalatPose provides feedback on whether the posture is correctly performed, guiding users to improve.

## 🌐 Use Cases

- **Educational Institutions**: Can be used in religious schools to teach students proper Salat postures.
- **Home Use**: Individuals can use SalatPose to practice and perfect their Salat postures.
- **Community Centers**: These are useful for group learning sessions in community centres.
